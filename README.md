# Hello, I'm Darshan Panchal! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Hereâ€™s a glimpse into what I'm currently focusing on and how you can engage with me:

I'm a software developer with a passion for building scalable web applications and working on challenging projects that require me to step out of my comfort zone. Hereâ€™s a little insight into my programming world.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on enhancing website usability and incorporating efficient, scalable APIs as a Full Stack Software Engineer at Arizona State University.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m actively learning Advanced React to deepen my expertise in front-end development.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking for effective ways to learn new technologies and refine my skills. Any tips or resources you could share would be greatly appreciated!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, my experiences with full-stack development, or anything related to tech!

âš¡ Fun fact: You can't understand recursion without understanding recursion.


## Technologies I Work With
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, TypeScript (React, Angular)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python
- **Databases**: MySQL, MongoDB, Postgres

I love connecting with different people so if you want to say hi, I'll be happy to meet you more! ðŸ˜Š
