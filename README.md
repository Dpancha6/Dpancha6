# Hello, I'm Darshan Panchal! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Hereâ€™s a glimpse into what I'm currently focusing on and how you can engage with me:

I'm a software developer with a passion for building scalable web applications 
and working on challenging projects that require me to step out of my comfort zone. 
Hereâ€™s a little insight into my programming world. <img src="https://github.com/Dpancha6/Dpancha6/assets/89943583/8757bcef-eb52-494f-a2a9-eff76b125e5a" width="250" height="250"/>


ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on enhancing website usability and incorporating 
efficient, scalable APIs as a Full Stack Software Engineer at Arizona State University.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m actively learning Advanced React to deepen my expertise in front-end development.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m always looking for effective ways to learn new technologies and refine my skills. 
Any tips or resources you could share would be greatly appreciated!

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, my experiences with full-stack development, or anything related to tech!

âš¡ Fun fact: You can't understand recursion without understanding recursion.

- **Backend**: Node.js, Python, Java
- **Databases**: MySQL, MongoDB, Postgres
- **Cloud and Deployment**â€¢: AWS, CI/CD, Azure, S3, EC2
